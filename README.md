# Drone
A DIY drone project - Work In Progress
Four guys trying to build a drone (quadcopter) from scratch :D

## Project
The brain of the drone is an Arduino Nano. We use a gyroscope and accelerometer to get the data necessary to control the drone. We have ha bluetooth module to communicate with the drone. Eventually we want to switch over to a RC-controller for extended range, but for testing and development purposes, the Bluetooth module works fine and lets us communicate with the drone through a basic android app (made with MIT App Developer).
*NB:* We are working on this project now, so the project, and code, is not finished and the drone doesn't fly (yet :wink:). We are currently tuning the regulators to make the drone able to hover.

## The parts
We ordered most of the parts on ebay, but some parts were bought at a workshop at NTNU (University).
